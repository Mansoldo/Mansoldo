#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work with IT almost 12 years, specially with analyze in system through PL/SQL or T-SQL. In the two last years, I've been working on technologies of BI/DS like Python, R, SQL and PowerBI. 
Besides that, I also likes to program in Java and JS.

- :computer: I'm currently working on Bionexo as BI Analyst
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: There are a lot of things that I'm learning, but the primary are PowerBI, PLSQL (Procedures/Packages/Functions), R and Python.
- :email: How to reach me: dmansoldo@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegomansoldo/

My resume in PBI (Power BI) and some projects. The projects still in the development phase.
